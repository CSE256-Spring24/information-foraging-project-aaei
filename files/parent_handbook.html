        <p>
          <b>Philosophy: </b>Washington	University	Nursery	School	teachers	are	attentive	to	individual	needs,	serving	as	
catalysts	to	spark	each	child’s	interests	and	desire	to	experiment	and	explore.	Our	school	
provides	a	safe,	nurturing	environment	that	encourages	growth	and	independence	in	all	
developmental	areas.
The	philosophy	of	the	nursery	school	is	that	children	learn	most effectively	through	play.	Our	
approach is	“hands-on,”	where	children	act	upon	what	they	are	learning	and	feeling.	We	
consider	the	process	more	important	than	the	product.	Teachers	provide	the	opportunity	for	
children	to	interact	with	their	environment	in	ways	that	are	meaningful	to	them. For	each	
class,	teachers	develop	a	curriculum	that	reflects	the	interests	and	abilities	of	the	children	in	
the	classroom.	In	addition,	all	children	actively	participate	with	specialists	in	science,	art,	
music	and	Spanish. As	trends	in	the	field	of	early	education	change,	we	evaluate	what	is	new	
and	determine	if	it	would	be	enriching	for	our	program.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Vision Statement: </b>
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Values	children	for	their	wonder	and	curiosity,	their	ideas	and	creativity,	and	their	
          delight	in	play
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Values	families	for	their	traditions	and	goals,	their	commitment	to	home,	work,	play,	
          community,	and	their	dreams	for	their	children
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Values	teachers	for	their	vision,	their	job	in	children’s	play	and	achievements,	their	
          flexibility	and	skill,	and	their	commitment	and	compassion.		We	support	and	respect	
          what	we	learn	from	each	other

      <button class="accordion">Parent School Partnership</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <b>Parent School Partnership: </b>When	joined	by	a	common	set	of	beliefs	and	purposes,	a	school	and	its	parents	form	a	
          powerful	team	with	far-reaching positive	effects	on	children	and	the	entire	school	
          community.	As	a	result,	WUNS	relies	on	its	parents	to	understand	and	embrace	the	School’s	
          philosophy	and	values,	and	fully	support	its	curriculum,	teachers/staff,	and	administration.	
          Working	together,	parents	and	school	professionals	exert	a	strong	influence	on	children’s	
          development	and	help	them	to	mature	by	modeling	healthy	adult	working	relationships	
          based	on	honesty,	trust,	civility,	and	mutual	respect.	The	teachers,	staff,	and	administration	
          of	WUNS	share	our	parents’	commitment	to	their	children	and	join	them	in	partnership	
          dedicated	to	the	growth	of	each	child.	This	partnership	begins	with	timely,	honest	and	open	
          communication	between	home	and	school,	and	is	premised	on	an	assumption	of	goodwill	
          and a	shared	interest	in	what	is	best	for	each	individual	child.	Parents	can	best	support	this	
          climate	of	trust	and	respect	by	communicating	concerns	openly	and	constructively	to	the	
          teacher.	If	a	satisfactory	conclusion	is	not	reached,	the	parent	should	then contact	the	
          Director.	Out	of	respect	for	the	individual	needs	and	privacy	of	each	family,	the	Nursery	
          School places	a	high	value	on	confidentiality	and	expects	individual	families	to	honor	the	
          same.	Efforts	to	lobby	other	parents	are	contrary	to	the	spirit	of	the	Parent	School	
          Partnership.	By	enrolling	their	child(ren)	in	WUNS,	parents	agree	to	support	the	School’s	
          vision,	follow	its	rules	and	policies,	and	abide	by	its	decisions.	Just	as	parents	can	expect	the	
          Nursery	School to	share	timely	information	and	concerns	with	families	concerning	their
          child,	so	too	the	Nursery	School	expects	parents	to	approach	issues	and	concerns	in	a	spirit	
          of	mutual	goodwill,	using	proper	channels,	and	in	a	manner	that	gives	everyone	the	benefit	of	
          the	doubt	and	leads	to	collaborative	and	constructive	solutions.	While	parents	may	not	agree	
          with	every	decision,	in	most	cases,	the	parents	and	Nursery	School	will	find	enough	common	
          ground	to	continue	a	mutually	respectful	and	productive	relationship.	However,	when	it	is	
          clear	that	a	constructive,	positive	relationship	cannot	be	maintained,	the	School	reserves	the	
          right	to	deny	continued	attendance	or	re-enrollment.

      <button class="accordion">History</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <b>History: </b>The	Washington	University	Nursery	School	was	founded	in	1947	as	a	cooperative	venture	of	
          faculty	and	Washington	University	in	St.	Louis.	The	primary	purpose	of	the	nursery	school	is	
          to	provide	the	highest	quality	preschool	program	for	children	2	years	and	7	months	to	5	
          years	of	age.	Today	about	70	percent	of	the	children	are	from	families	of	Washington	
          University	in	St.	Louis	faculty,	staff	and	students, and	the	remaining	are	from	families	in	the	
          community.
          Children	come	from	a	variety	of	countries,	cultures	and	economic	backgrounds. The	school	
          maintains	the	high	standards	of	the	National	Association	for	the	Education	of	Young	
          Children,	by	which it is	accredited.	It	is	licensed	by	the	State	of	Missouri.
          6
          The	nursery	school	also	serves	as	a	site	for	research	in	child	development.	Washington	
          University	undergraduate	and	graduate	students	are	employed	to	assist in	the	classrooms.	
          The	classroom	teachers,	as	well	as	the	nursery	school’s	director,	supervise	them.	The	student	
          workers’	presence	enables	children	to	receive	additional	individual	attention.
          The	nursery	school	is	located	on	the	Washington	University	campus.	It	is	composed	of	three	
          classrooms, which	are	designed	to	offer	children	a	variety	of	choices	in	their	play.	Two	
          additional	all-purpose	rooms	are	equipped	with	a	library	and	a	variety	of	indoor	gross	motor	
          play	materials. A	large	outdoor	play	area	gives	children	the	opportunity	to	run,	bike,	swing,	
          climb,	slide	and	play	in	the	sand.

      <button class="accordion">Staff</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <b>Staff: </b>The	staff	at	the	nursery	school	respects	and	appreciates	the	talents	and	personalities	of	each	
          child	and	his	or	her	family.	A	teacher’s	individual	talents	are	also	encouraged	as	she	or	he	
          develops	his	or	her	own	personal	approach	in	the	classroom.	This	makes	for	a	vibrant,	
          growing	community	of	children,	families	and	teachers.
          In	general,	teachers	hold	a	Bachelor	or	Master	degree	in	early	childhood or	elementary
          education	and/or	teaching.		All	have	extensive	early	childhood	teaching	experience.
          (https://nurseryschool.wustl.edu/about/staff/)
          Professional	development	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.		The	school	pays	fees	for	
          workshops	and	conferences	during	the	year.		In	addition,	there	are	two teacher	in-service	
          days	and	monthly	staff	meetings.		All	teachers	are	certified	in CPR	and	First	Aid.

      <button class="accordion">Curriculum</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          <b>Curriculum: </b>At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	children	are	unique	individuals	
          with	their	own	patterns	and	timetables	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
          development.		We	support	and	encourage	their	development	through	our	child-centered,	
          process-oriented,	play-based	curriculum	built	on	Constructivist	theories	and	practices.		
          Guided	by	the	teachings	of	educational	theorists	including	Piaget,	Dewey,	Vygotsky,	DeVries,	
          and	others,	we	create	a	learning	environment	that	addresses	the	developmental	needs	of	the	
          whole	child	by:
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Structuring	classroom	experiences	around	ideas	and	topics	that	are	relevant	to	the	
          students,	with	the	understanding	that	knowledge	is	constructed	through	language,	
          discussion,	experimentation,	and	manipulation	of	objects	that	are	meaningful	to	
          them.
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Offering	learning	experiences	that	appeal	to	multiple	senses	and	that	provide	
          hands-on	activities	using	materials	that	encourage	exploration,	investigation,	and	learning.
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Allowing	each	child	to	interact	with	the	environment	at	his/her	own	pace,	and	
          creating	opportunities	for	children	to	explore	individually,	with	a	partner,	or	with	a	
          larger	group	of	peers.
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Asking	open-ended	questions,	allowing	students	the	time	to	thoughtfully	form	
          responses,	listening	respectfully	to	their	answers,	and	gently	guiding	them	toward	
          the	answers	they seek	as	they	develop	enhanced	reasoning	skills
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Respecting	students’	ideas,	encouraging	independent	thinking,	and	empowering	
          students	to	become	problem	solvers.
          <p>     </p>
          &bull; Using	the	wonderful	resource	of	our	diverse,	multi-cultural	population	to	highlight	
          the	similarities	and	differences	between	individuals,	families,	and	cultures,	
          celebrating	the	unique	environment	that	is	Washington	University	Nursery	School.
          <p>     </p>
          The	Washington	University	Nursery	School’s	open	curriculum	framework	is	presented	to	
          children	in	ways	that	are	developmentally	appropriate	and	based	on	our	philosophy	that	
          children	learn	most	effectively through	play.		Using	a	learning	center	approach,	each	teaching	
          team	offers	experiences	in	art,	writing,	science,	dramatic	play,	blocks,	manipulatives,	and	
          literacy.		Teacher	planning	takes	into	account	the	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
          developmental	needs	of	the	child.
