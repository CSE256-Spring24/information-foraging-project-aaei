        <h2>Communicating with Parents</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails</b>	
                            give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events</li>
                            <li><b>Phone	calls	and/or	emails	by	teachers</b> are used	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
                            concerns</li>
                            <li><b>Email	
                                or	call	the	office</b>
                                 if	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director</li>
                            <li>Teachers	can	be	reached	by	<b>phone	or	email</b>	after	the	school	day	is	over.</li>

        <h2>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
            <p>
                The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
                informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
                more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
                time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.	
            </p>

            <h2>Assessments</h2>
            <p>
                Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
                conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers
                keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
                development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
                writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
                in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.
